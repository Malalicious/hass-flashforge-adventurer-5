# FlashForge Adventurer 3 for Home Assistant

A custom Home Assistant integration for the FlashForge Adventurer 3 printer.

TODO: add list of features
TODO: add screenshot here

## Installation

TODO, add it to HACS

## Todo

- expose camera stream as an entity
- expose progress as an entity
  - maybe all the temperatures as well?
- handle the printer going offline: show "offline" instead of "unavailable"
- display strings in the config flow
- delete the option flow
- display the list of supported printers in the config flow correctly (dropdown
  instead of radio boxes)

## More printers?

I only own the Adventurer 3 at the moment, so that's the only supported printer.
